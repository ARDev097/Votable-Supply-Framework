# üèõÔ∏è Votable Supply (FVS) and Ideal Votable Supply (IVS) Forecasting  

[Project Documentation](./DOCS.md) 
---

## üìå Overview  

This repository contains data, models, and methodologies for forecasting **Votable Supply (VS)** and **Ideal Votable Supply (IVS)** in the Optimism ecosystem. The project utilizes historical governance and tokenomics data to build predictive models using various machine learning techniques. The primary goal is to estimate future votable supply trends and derive an ideal voting power distribution.

## üìÇ Repository Structure  

The repository is structured into several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:  

### üìä Dataset/  
Contains all historical and predicted data used for forecasting votable supply and its related parameters.  

- **Historical_Data/**: Stores raw and processed historical data for key metrics such as liquidity activity ratio (LAR), actual voting power index (AVPI), OP price, participation ratio (PR), circulating supply (CS), and votable supply (VS).  
- **Prediction_Data/**: Contains forecasted values for various parameters used in predicting votable supply and Ideal votable supply.  
- **Future_Votable_Supply/**: Includes day-wise votable supply predictions.  
- **Future_Circulating_Supply/**: Stores predicted future circulating supply data.  
- **Ideal_Votable_Supply_Data/**: Contains comprehensive datasets for IVS calculations, including historical and forecasted values, weight combinations, and final IVS predictions.  

---

### üß† Models_and_Scripts/  
This directory houses machine learning models and scripts used for data processing, prediction, and IVS calculations.  

- **Parameters_Prediction/**: Contains individual parameter forecasting scripts (Liquidity Activity Ratio, Actual Voting Power Index, OP Price, and Participation Ratio).  
- **Future_Votable_Supply/**: Implements the main votable supply forecasting model.  
- **Ideal_Votable_Supply_Scripts/**: Step-by-step scripts for calculating and validating the ideal votable supply.  

---

### üîç LLM-Approach/  
This section explores how Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist in token governance insights and votable supply forecasting.  

- **Docs/**: Collection of research insights generated using LLMs.  
- **Only LLM/**: Pure LLM-based insights without additional data integration.  
- **Votable-supply-data-forecasting/**: LLM-powered forecasting models for votable supply and its components.  
- **With SARIMA/**: Forecasting using SARIMA models alongside LLM-based analysis.

## üìà Key Findings  
Our forecasting models predict votable supply trends and provide an ideal voting power distribution. The results contribute to governance efficiency by estimating voting power concentration and proposing a balanced distribution approach.
